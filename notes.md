<Cybersecurity is the ongoing effort to protect individuals, organizations and governments from digital attacks by protecting networked systems and data from unauthorized use or harm.>

* Useful tips to help you generate your username:

    - Don’t use your full name or parts of your address or phone number.
    - Don’t use your email username.
    - Don’t use the same username and password combination, especially on financial accounts.
    - Don’t choose a super-odd username and then reuse it again and again — it makes you easier to track.
    - Don’t choose a username that gives clues to your passwords such as a series of numbers/letters or the first part of a two-part phrase, such as knock-knock or starlight, or the department in which you work, such as IT.
    - Do choose a username that’s appropriate for the type of account, i.e., business, social or personal.

/// TYPE OF DATA ///

* Traditional Data

<Traditional data is typically generated and maintained by all organizations, big and small. It includes the following:>

  - Transactional data such as details relating to buying and selling, production activities and basic organizational operations such as any information used to make employment decisions.
  - Intellectual property such as patents, trademarks and new product plans, which allows an organization to gain economic advantage over its competitors. This information is often considered a trade secret and losing it could prove disastrous for the future of a company.
  - Financial data such as income statements, balance sheets and cash flow statements, which provide insight into the health of a company.


  * The McCumber Cube is a model framework created by John McCumber in 1991 to help organizations establish and evaluate information security initiatives by considering all of the related factors that impact them. This security model has three dimensions:

  1 - The foundational principles for protecting information systems.
  2 - The protection of information in each of its possible states.
  3 - The security measures used to protect data.

- The foundational principles for protecting information.
   <Confidentiality is a set of rules that prevents sensitive information from being disclosed to unauthorized people, resources and processes.>

   <Integrity ensures that system information or processes are protected from intentional or accidental modification. >

   <Availability means that authorized users are able to access systems and data when and where needed and those that do not meet established conditions, are not.>

- The protection of information in each of its possible states.
    <Processing refers to data that is being used to perform an operation such as updating a database record (data in process).>

    <Storage refers to data stored in memory or on a permanent storage device such as a hard drive, solid-state drive or USB drive (data at rest).>

    <Transmission refers to data traveling between information systems (data in transit).?

- The security measures used to protect data.
    <Awareness, training and education are the measures put in place by an organization to ensure that users are knowledgeable about potential security threats and the actions they can take to protect information systems.>

    <Technology refers to the software- and hardware-based solutions designed to protect information systems such as firewalls, which continuously monitor your network in search of possible malicious incidents.>

    <Policy and procedure refers to the administrative controls that provide a foundation for how an organization implements information assurance, such as incident response plans and best practice guidelines.>

    * A security breach is an incident that results in unauthorized access to data, applications, services or devices, exposing private information that attackers can use for financial gain or other advantages.

    <Cyberwarfare: is the use of technology to penetrate and attack another nation’s computer systems and networks in an effort to cause damage or disrupt services.>

/// Types of Malware: 

- Spyware: Monitors your online activity and can log every key you press on your keyboard
- Adware: Designed to automatically deliver advertisements to a user
- Backdoor: Used to gain unauthorized access by bypassing the normal authentication procedures to access a sy
stem.
- Ransomware: Designed to hold a computer system or the data it contains captive until a payment is made.
- Scareware: Malware that uses 'scare’ tactics to trick you into taking a specific action.
- Rootkit: Designed to modify the operating system to create a backdoor, which attackers can then use to access your computer remotely.
- Virus: Type of computer program that, when executed, replicates and attaches itself to other executable files, such as a document, by inserting its own code.
- Trojan horse: This malware carries out malicious operations by masking its true intent.
- Worms: Type of malware that replicates itself in order to spread from one computer to another.

* //// METHOS OF INFILTRACION //// 

<Social_engineering is the manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. Social engineers often rely on people’s willingness to be helpful, but they also prey on their weaknesses.>

<!-- Denial-of-Service  -->
- (DoS) attacks are a type of network attack that is relatively simple to carry out, even by an unskilled attacker. A DoS attack results in some sort of interruption of network service to users, devices or applications.

<!-- Botnet -->
- A bot computer is typically infected by visiting an unsafe website or opening an infected email attachment or infected media file. 
- A botnet is a group of bots, connected through the Internet, that can be controlled by a malicious individual or group. 
- These bots can be activated to distribute malware, launch DDoS attacks, distribute spam email, or execute brute-force password attacks. Cybercriminals will often rent out botnets to third parties for nefarious purposes.

<!-- On path attacks -->
- On-path attackers intercept or modify communications between two devices, such as a web browser and a web server, either to collect information from or to impersonate one of the devices. This type of attack is also referred to as a man-in-the-middle(MitM) or man-in-the-mobile attack (MITMO).

<!-- SEO poisoning -->
- Attackers take advantage of popular terms and use SEO (search engine optimization) to push malicious sits higher up the ranks os search results. This thecnique is called SEO poisoning.
